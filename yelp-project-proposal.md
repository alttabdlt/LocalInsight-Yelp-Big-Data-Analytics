# Big Data Analytics Project Proposal: Yelp Business Intelligence

## Project Title
"LocalInsight: Big Data Analytics for Business Success Factors in the Service Industry"

## Project Overview
This project will analyze the comprehensive Yelp dataset to identify key factors that influence business success in the service industry. By applying big data processing techniques to millions of reviews, business attributes, and user data, we'll develop models that can predict business performance and provide actionable insights for entrepreneurs and business owners.

## Project Objectives
1. Identify patterns in consumer sentiment across different business categories and locations
2. Determine key business attributes that correlate with high customer satisfaction
3. Analyze the relationship between review patterns, business hours, and overall success
4. Build predictive models for business rating trends based on features and customer feedback
5. Visualize geographic and temporal patterns in customer preferences

## Dataset Details
The Yelp Dataset includes:
- Business data (location, attributes, hours, categories)
- Review data (text, rating, usefulness votes)
- User data (profile information, friend connections)
- Check-in data (time patterns for customer visits)
- Tip data (short comments left by users)

This dataset is particularly well-suited for our project as it provides a comprehensive view of businesses, including both structured attributes and unstructured review content, along with spatial and temporal dimensions.

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Data Storage
- **Task**: Store the Yelp dataset in a distributed file system
- **Tools**: Hadoop HDFS
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Set up Hadoop cluster configuration
  2. Create appropriate directory structure in HDFS
     ```bash
     hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/localinsight/raw/business
     hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/localinsight/raw/reviews
     hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/localinsight/raw/users
     hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/localinsight/raw/checkin
     hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/localinsight/processed
     ```
  3. Load dataset into HDFS, organizing by data type
     ```bash
     hadoop fs -put yelp_academic_dataset_business.json /user/localinsight/raw/business/
     hadoop fs -put yelp_academic_dataset_review.json /user/localinsight/raw/reviews/
     hadoop fs -put yelp_academic_dataset_user.json /user/localinsight/raw/users/
     hadoop fs -put yelp_academic_dataset_checkin.json /user/localinsight/raw/checkin/
     hadoop fs -put yelp_academic_dataset_tip.json /user/localinsight/raw/tips/
     ```
  4. Verify data is correctly stored and accessible

### 2. Data Processing with Hadoop MapReduce
- **Task**: Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis
- **Tools**: Hadoop MapReduce
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. **First MapReduce Job**: Business Data Processing
     - Map phase: Parse business JSON data, extract key attributes
     - Reduce phase: Organize businesses by category and location
     ```java
     public static class BusinessMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, Text> {
         public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
             try {
                 JSONObject business = new JSONObject(value.toString());
                 String businessId = business.getString("business_id");
                 String category = extractMainCategory(business);
                 String city = business.getJSONObject("location").getString("city");
                 String state = business.getJSONObject("location").getString("state");
                 
                 // Output by location
                 context.write(new Text(state + ":" + city), new Text(businessId + "|" + category));
             } catch (JSONException e) {
                 context.getCounter("Data Cleaning", "Corrupted Records").increment(1);
             }
         }
     }
     ```
  
  2. **Second MapReduce Job**: Review Sentiment Extraction
     - Map phase: Process review text, extract sentiment indicators
     - Reduce phase: Aggregate sentiment by business ID
  
  3. **Third MapReduce Job**: Temporal Pattern Analysis
     - Map phase: Process check-in data and review timestamps
     - Reduce phase: Create temporal profiles for each business

### 3. Data Analysis with Spark
- **Task**: Perform advanced analytics on the processed data
- **Tools**: Apache Spark (PySpark)
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. **Business Success Factors Analysis**:
     ```python
     from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
     from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
     from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
     
     # Create Spark session
     spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("YelpBusinessAnalysis").getOrCreate()
     
     # Load preprocessed data
     business_df = spark.read.json("hdfs:///user/localinsight/processed/business")
     reviews_df = spark.read.json("hdfs:///user/localinsight/processed/reviews")
     
     # Join business data with aggregated review data
     joined_df = business_df.join(reviews_df, "business_id")
     
     # Prepare features for analysis
     feature_cols = ["price_level", "is_open", "review_count", "has_wifi", 
                    "noise_level", "takes_reservations", "avg_sentiment"]
     
     # Create feature vector
     assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
     final_data = assembler.transform(joined_df)
     
     # Train regression model for star rating prediction
     lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="stars")
     model = lr.fit(final_data)
     
     # Extract feature importance
     coefficients = model.coefficients
     feature_importance = list(zip(feature_cols, coefficients))
     ```
  
  2. **Geographic Analysis**:
     - Analyze business success patterns by geographic region
     - Identify neighborhood effects and location factors
     - Map business density against review sentiment
  
  3. **Temporal Analysis**:
     - Analyze business review patterns over time
     - Identify seasonality in customer sentiment
     - Correlate business operating hours with success metrics

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- **Task**: Develop models to predict business success
- **Tools**: Spark MLlib
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Feature engineering from business attributes and review patterns
  2. Train models to predict:
     - Future star ratings
     - Business longevity (likelihood of remaining open)
     - Review volume trends
  
  Sample implementation:
  ```python
  from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier
  from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator
  
  # Create a binary target for business success (above 4 stars)
  training_data = final_data.withColumn("success", 
                                       (final_data.stars >= 4.0).cast("double"))
  
  # Train random forest model
  rf = RandomForestClassifier(featuresCol="features", labelCol="success", 
                             numTrees=100, maxDepth=5)
  model = rf.fit(training_data)
  
  # Make predictions
  predictions = model.transform(test_data)
  
  # Evaluate model
  evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="success")
  accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
  ```

### 5. Data Visualization
- **Task**: Create visualizations to communicate insights
- **Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium (for maps)
